Connect Four is a two-player strategy game where the objective is to connect four of your coloured discs vertically, horizontally, or diagonally on the game board before your opponent does. Each player takes turns dropping one of their coloured discs into one of the seven columns on the game board. The discs fall to the lowest available space in the column. The game ends when one player connects four of their coloured discs in a row or when the game board is full and neither player has won. In an offline multiplayer version of the game, the two players would take turns playing on the same physical game board.
